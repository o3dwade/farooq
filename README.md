Zulip
=====

Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. Written in
Python and using the Django framework, Zulip supports both private
messaging and group chats via conversation streams.

Zulip also supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image
previews, group private messages, audible notifications,
missed-message emails, desktop apps, and much more.

Further information on the Zulip project and its features can be found
at https://www.zulip.org.

How to get involved with contributing to Zulip
==============================================

First, subscribe to the Zulip [development discussion mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zulip-devel).

The Zulip project uses a system of labels in our [issue
tracker](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues) to make it easy to
find a project if you don't have your own project idea in mind or want
to get some experience with working on Zulip before embarking on a
larger project you have in mind:

* [Bite Size](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/bite%20size):
  Smaller projects that could be a great first contribution.
* [Integrations](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/integrations).
  Integrate Zulip with another piece of software and contribute it
  back to the community!  Writing an integration can be a great
  started project.  There's some brief documentation on the best way
  to write integrations at https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/70.
* [Documentation](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/documentation).
  The Zulip project loves contributions of new documentation.
* [Help Wanted](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/help%20wanted):
  A broader list of projects that nobody is currently working on.
* [Platform support](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/Platform%20support).
  These are open issues about making it possible to install Zulip on a wider
  range of platforms.
* [Bugs](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/bug). Open bugs.
* [Feature requests](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/enhancement).
  Browsing this list can be a great way to find feature ideas to implement that
  other Zulip users are excited about.

If you're excited about helping with an open issue, just post on the
conversation thread that you're working on it.  You're encouraged to
ask questions on how to best implement or debug your changes -- the
Zulip maintainers are excited to answer questions to help you stay
unblocked and working efficiently.

We also welcome suggestions of features that you feel would be
valuable or changes that you feel would make Zulip a better open
source project, and are happy to support you in adding new features or
other user experience improvements to Zulip.

If you have a new feature you'd like to add, we recommend you start by
opening a GitHub issue about the feature idea explaining the problem
that you're hoping to solve and that you're excited to work on it.  A
Zulip maintainer will usually reply within a day with feedback on the
idea, notes on any important issues or concerns, and and often tips on
how to implement or test it.  Please feel free to ping the thread if
you don't hear a response from the maintainers -- we try to be very
responsive so this usually means we missed your message.

For significant changes to the visual design, user experience, data
model, or architecture, we highly recommend posting a mockup,
screenshot, or description of what you have in mind to zulip-devel@ to
get broad feedback before you spend too much time on implementation
details.

Finally, before implementing a larger feature, we highly recommend
looking at the new feature tutorial and coding style guidelines on
ReadTheDocs.

Feedback on how to make this development process more efficient, fun,
and friendly to new contributors is very welcome!  Just shoot an email
to the Zulip Developers list with your thoughts.

Installing the Zulip Development environment
============================================

You will need a machine with at least 2GB of RAM available (see
https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/32 for a plan for how to
dramatically reduce this requirement).

Start by cloning this repository: `git clone https://github.com/zulip/zulip.git`

Using Vagrant
-------------

This is the recommended approach, and is tested on OS X 10.10 as well as Ubuntu 14.04.

* If your host is Ubuntu 14.04 (or newer), then just download Vagrant from their website(https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and download it for Ubuntu, then go to the directory of which you downloaded the file, and run "sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb", where 'packagename.deb' is the name of the file you downloaded from their website. This will give you the updated version of Vagrant which should help set up your Zulip on your machine. 

* If your host is OS X, [download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads),
  [download Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html), and install them both.

Once that's done, simply change to your zulip directory and run
`vagrant up` in your terminal to install the development server.  This
will take a long time on the first run because Vagrant needs to
download the Ubuntu Trusty base image, but later you can run `vagrant
destroy` and then `vagrant up` again to rebuild the environment and it
will be much faster.

Once that finishes, you can run the development server as follows:

```
vagrant ssh -- -L9991:localhost:9991
# Now inside the container
cd /srv/zulip
source /srv/zulip-venv/bin/activate
./tools/run-dev.py --interface=''
```

You can now visit <http://localhost:9991/> in your browser.  To get
shell access to the virtual machine running the server, use `vagrant ssh`.

(A small note on tools/run-dev.py: the `--interface=''` option will make
the development server listen on all network interfaces.  While this
is correct for the Vagrant guest sitting behind a NAT, you probably
don't want to use that option when using run-dev.py in other environments).

The run-dev.py console output will show any errors your Zulip
development server encounters.  It runs on top of Django's [manage.py
runserver](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/django-admin/#runserver-port-or-address-port)
tool, which will automatically restart the Zulip Django and Tornado
servers whenever you save changes to Python code.

However, the Zulip queue workers will not automatically restart when
you save changes, so you will need to ctrl-C and then restart
`run-dev.py` manually if you are testing changes to the queue workers
or if a queue worker has crashed.

Using provision.py without Vagrant
----------------------------------

If you'd like to install a Zulip development environment on a server
that's already running Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty, you can do that by just
running:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python-pbs
python /srv/zulip/provision.py

cd /srv/zulip
source /srv/zulip-venv/bin/activate
./tools/run-dev.py
```

By hand
-------
If you really want to install everything by hand, the below
instructions should work.

Install the following non-Python dependencies:
 * libffi-dev — needed for some Python extensions
 * postgresql 9.1 or later — our database (also install development headers)
 * memcached (and headers)
 * rabbitmq-server
 * libldap2-dev
 * python-dev
 * redis-server — rate limiting
 * tsearch-extras — better text search
 * libfreetype6-dev - needed before you pip install Pillow to properly generate emoji PNGs

On Debian or Ubuntu systems:

```
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev memcached rabbitmq-server libldap2-dev python-dev redis-server postgresql-server-dev-all libmemcached-dev libfreetype6-dev

# If on 12.04 or wheezy:
sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.1
wget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/283158365/zuliposs/postgresql-9.1-tsearch-extras_0.1.2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i postgresql-9.1-tsearch-extras_0.1.2_amd64.deb

# If on 14.04:
sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.3
wget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/283158365/zuliposs/postgresql-9.3-tsearch-extras_0.1.2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i postgresql-9.3-tsearch-extras_0.1.2_amd64.deb

# If on 15.04 or jessie:
sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.4
wget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/283158365/zuliposs/postgresql-9.4-tsearch-extras_0.1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i postgresql-9.4-tsearch-extras_0.1_amd64.deb
```

Now continue with the "All systems" instructions below.

On Fedora 22 (experimental):

```
sudo dnf install libffi-devel memcached rabbitmq-server openldap-devel python-devel redis postgresql-server postgresql-devel postgresql libmemcached-devel freetype-devel
wget https://launchpad.net/~tabbott/+archive/ubuntu/zulip/+files/tsearch-extras_0.1.3.tar.gz
tar xvzf tsearch-extras_0.1.3.tar.gz
cd ts2
make
sudo make install

# Hack around missing dictionary files -- need to fix this to get
# the proper dictionaries from what in debian is the hunspell-en-us package.
sudo touch /usr/share/pgsql/tsearch_data/english.stop
sudo touch /usr/share/pgsql/tsearch_data/en_us.dict
sudo touch /usr/share/pgsql/tsearch_data/en_us.affix

# Edit the postgres settings:
sudo vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf

# Add this line before the first uncommented line to enable password auth:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5

# Start the services
sudo systemctl start redis memcached rabbitmq-server postgresql
```

All Systems:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./tools/download-zxcvbn
./tools/emoji_dump/build_emoji
./scripts/setup/generate_secrets.py -d
sudo cp ./puppet/zulip/files/postgresql/zulip_english.stop /usr/share/postgresql/9.3/tsearch_data/
./scripts/setup/configure-rabbitmq
./tools/postgres-init-dev-db
./tools/do-destroy-rebuild-database
./tools/postgres-init-test-db
./tools/do-destroy-rebuild-test-database
```

To start the development server:

```
./tools/run-dev.py
```

… and visit [http://localhost:9991/](http://localhost:9991/).


Running the test suite
======================

Run all tests:

```
./tools/test-all
```

This runs the linter (`tools/lint-all`) plus all of our test suites;
they can all be run separately (just read `tools/test-all` to see
them).  You can also run individual tests which can save you a lot of
time debugging a test failure, e.g.:

```
./tools/test-backend zerver.test_bugdown.BugdownTest.test_inline_youtube
./tools/test-js-with-casper 10-navigation.js
./tools/test-js-with-node # Runs all node tests but is very fast
```

The above instructions include the first-time setup of test databases,
but you may need to rebuild the test database occasionally if you're
working on new database migrations.  To do this, run:

```
./tools/postgres-init-test-db
./tools/do-destroy-rebuild-test-database
```

Possible testing issues
=======================

- The Casper tests are flaky on the Virtualbox environment (probably
  due to some performance-sensitive races; they work reliably in
  Travis CI).  Until this issue is debugged, you may need to rerun
  them to get them to pass.

- When running the test suite, if you get an error like this:

  ```
      sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: (ProgrammingError) function ts_match_locs_array(unknown, text, tsquery) does not   exist
      LINE 2: ...ECT message_id, flags, subject, rendered_content, ts_match_l...
                                                                   ^
  ```

  … then you need to install tsearch-extras, described
  above. Afterwards, re-run the `init*-db` and the
  `do-destroy-rebuild*-database` scripts.

- When building the development environment using Vagrant and the LXC provider, if you encounter permissions errors, you may need to `chown -R 1000:$(whoami) /path/to/zulip` on the host before running `vagrant up` in order to ensure that the synced directory has the correct owner during provision. This issue will arise if you run `id username` on the host where `username` is the user running Vagrant and the output is anything but 1000.
  This seems to be caused by Vagrant behavior; more information can be found here https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/wiki/FAQ#help-my-shared-folders-have-the-wrong-owner
